                  Another, often untalked, aspect of the program was homosexuality. There's evidence that it happened in the camps. Prostitution was present in 
                  the camps, yet some men participated in sexual relationships with other men. Other men didn't seem to condemn this.

                  the identity of his lover. The men didn't confront the man based on his sexual preference but their annoyance of the light being cut.

                  Sometimes Braceros would leave families behind in Mexico and make new ones in the U.S. Sometimes
                  they stayed with thes new families and other times they returned home and abandoned their U.S families.

                  This became such a problem that some Mexican women appealed to the Mexican government to force their husbands to support them financially or return home. 
                  Others, emboldened by the absence of their husband, simply sought out new partners.
